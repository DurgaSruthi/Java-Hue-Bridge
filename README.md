# Philips-Hue-Bridge-Java-Interface
Java class interface for the Philips Hue Bridge.

This Java interface works getting the Philips Hue Bridge's right local ip address from meethue.com/api/nupnp .
Then a lot of methods are provided to interact with the Hue Bulbs.

getLightBrightness, getLightSaturation, getLightHue, getLightState, and so on...
